## Topics

1. Java concepts and terminology
2. Exceptions
    - Checked vs. unchecked
    - Try, catch, finally
    - Throwing and catching exceptions
3. OOP concepts
    - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
    - Static vs non-static
    - public, private, and protected
    - interfaces vs abstract classes
    - classes than can be instantiated versus those that cannot
    - Up-casting versus down-casting
4. Read and draw UML diagrams and know notations
    - public (+), private (-), and protected (#)
    - abstract methods are in italic
    - final methods are underlined
5. Inheritance and polymorphism
    - copy constructors
    - toString methods
    - equals methods
    - compareTo methods
    - clone methods
6. GUIs
    - Know how to use the ActionListener interface and the actionPerformed method
7. Text and binary files
    - Read and process data from a Scanner or PrintWriter object tied to text file
    - Read binary data using a FileInputStream or a DataInputStream
    - Write binary data using FileOutputStream or DataOutputStream
8. Time complexity
    - Big-O basics
    - Time complexity terms and notations – O(1): constant, O(log n): logarithmic, O(n): linear, O(n log n): Log-linear, O(n2): Quadratic, O(n3): Cubic
    - Determine time complexity of a given code fragment
9. Recursion
    - Tracing recursive methods
    - Illustrating the call stack due to recursive method calls
    - Converting iterative methods to recursive methods
    - Converting recursive methods to iterative methods
10. Sorting algorithms
    - Selection sort
    - Quick sort – partitioning method and identifying pivot
    - Merge sort
11. Containers
    - ArrayList
    - Set
    - HashMap
12. Boolean expressions
    - Comparison of primitive data types versus Objects, using == and equals()
    - Using getClass vs instanceof method
13. Tracing
    - if...else statements including nested if statements
    - else-if statements
    - multi-way if statements.
    - Applying all forms of if...else and switch statements for problem solving.
14. Loops
    - Tracing operations of loops and nested loops
    - Loops for number of manipulations
    - Loops for validating user inputs
    - String manipulations (transforming characters and words in a string) and processing (searching/counting).
    - Using loops for processing 1-D and 2-D arrays of objects and interfaces.

## Non-comprehensive list of expected problems to solve
- Create an object that extends the Point class and implements the Comparable interface and Clonable interface.
- Override specific methods in a derived class.
- Process numbers returned by polymorphic objects/methods and determine properties about the number.
- Let the user enter data (number or string) and validate the data to be sure that it meets desired requirements and create objects with the data.
- Take data from a file and read some or all of it into an array or an ArrayList.
- Take data from an array or an ArrayList and write it to a text file.
- Find the largest or smallest object of a given class type in a list based on value returned by compareTo method.
    - § Know the difference between using instanceof versus checking class name
- Find the second largest or smallest object using compareTo method.
- Eliminate all duplicate objects using the equals method.
- Randomly distribute objects from an ArrayList into a 2-D array.
- Draw an UML diagram for a given class hierarchy
- Convert a given UML diagram to a given class hierarchy
- Identify different types of compiler errors in a hierarchy of classes:
    - Cannot override a method in the base class
    - Incorrect overrides of methods in the base class
    - Invalid access to protected/private members in base class
    - Invalid access to protected/private members in a different class.
    - Invalid implementation of interface method
    - Implementing two different interfaces that have exactly the same method in them.
    - Identify compiler errors with down-casting.
- Identify different runtime issues that may arise in an object-oriented Java program
    - Runtime errors due to up-casting or down-casting operations
    - Runtime errors due to incorrect use of instanceof versus checking the actual class
- GUI operations
    - Suitably process button clicks in a GUI to perform a specific operation in the actionPerformed method.
